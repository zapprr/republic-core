# republic-core
An all-in-one, general purpose framework for menu-based FiveM servers. Originally spun off from code created for San Andreas Republic.

This requires the following scripts to work:
- [NativeUILua_Reloaded](https://github.com/sdiaz/NativeUILua_Reloaded)
- [pma-voice](https://github.com/AvarianKnight/pma-voice)
- [discord_perms](https://github.com/logan-mcgee/discord_perms)
- [rp-radio](https://github.com/FrazzIe/rp-radio) 
- [blip-info](https://github.com/glitchdetector/fivem-blip-info)

To-Do:
- Refactor code to make the codebase readable & expandable
- Ensure customisability is easy to do
- Fix any/all bugs
- Update from discord_perms to Discordroles
