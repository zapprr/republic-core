# republic-core
An all-in-one, general purpose framework for menu-based FiveM servers. Originally spun off from code created for San Andreas Republic.

This requires the following scripts to work:
- pma-voice
- discord_perms
- rp-radio
- blip-info

To-Do:
- Refactor code to make the codebase readable & expandable
- Ensure customisability is easy to do
- Fix any/all bugs
