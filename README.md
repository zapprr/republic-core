# republic-core
An all-in-one, general purpose framework for menu-based FiveM servers. Originally spun off from code created for San Andreas Republic.

## Dependencies
This requires the following scripts to work:
- [NativeUILua_Reloaded](https://github.com/sdiaz/NativeUILua_Reloaded) (Must be named `NativeUILua_Reloaded`)
- [blip-info](https://github.com/glitchdetector/fivem-blip-info) (Must be named `blip_info`)
- [bob74_ipl](https://github.com/Bob74/bob74_ipl) (Must be named `bob74_ipl`)
- [pma-voice](https://github.com/AvarianKnight/pma-voice) (Must be named `pma-voice`)
- [discord_perms](https://github.com/logan-mcgee/discord_perms) (Must be named `discord_perms`)
- [rp-radio](https://github.com/AvarianKnight/rp-radio) (Must be named `rp-radio`)

## To-Do:
- Refactor code to make the codebase readable & expandable
- Ensure customisability is easy to do
- Fix any/all bugs
- Update from discord_perms to Discordroles
- Generally improve the experience for those installing this script onto a fresh server/integrating it into an existing one
- Make a list of all features (at this point there's so many in here we kinda need it)
- Figure out what licence we wanna publish this under (e.g. creative commons?)
- Props for Prop Menu
