-- Blips can be defined here. Here's an example for you:

	--{category = "Business", type="Bank", id=102, x=-109.7, y=6463.6, name = "Blaine County Savings Paleto", image = "bcs_paleto"},
	--{category = "Business", type="Gun Store", id=110, x=1697.781, y=3753.256, name = "Ammunation Sandy Shores", image = "ammunation_sandy", phone = "1-999-WEAPONS", bleeter = "@Ammunation"},

-- The four categories supported are Business, Government, Public Transport, and Public Space.
-- The image will appear in the top left while hovering over a blip. You need to upload it as a streamed .ytd file for it to work.
-- The phone and Bleeter tags are optional.
-- An optional location tag can be added, which will define where the blip appears (for example, Cayo Perico, North Yankton). By default, all blips are treated as part of San Andreas's location.
